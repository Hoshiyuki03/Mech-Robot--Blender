A project by an aspiring game designer exploring 3D modeling and animation.
This project features a low-poly mech robot model created in Blender 4.5.1 LTS. It was built as part of my journey to learn 3D design, animation, and environment setup for game development.
The mech was designed with a focus on clean topology, modular parts, and a stylized look suitable for integration into game engines like Unity or Unreal Engine.

As an aspiring game designer, my goal is to blend creativity and technology — bringing unique mechanical designs to life while learning the fundamentals of 3D modeling, animation, and rendering.
This mech represents the early stages of my journey into building game-ready assets from scratch.
